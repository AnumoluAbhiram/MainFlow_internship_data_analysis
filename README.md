Task-1
Under Standing the Python Data types:
Description:
This task involves understanding the basic datatypes in Python such as lists, dictionaries, andsets.
Responsibility:
Write a Python program to create a list, a dictionary, and a set. Perform basic operations like adding, removing, and modifying elements.

List:

A list is an ordered collection of items that is mutable, meaning the elements within it can be changed after its creation.
Lists can contain elements of different data types, including other lists.
Lists are defined by enclosing elements in square brackets [].
python
Copy code
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Set:

A set is an unordered collection of unique elements, meaning no duplicates are allowed.
Sets are mutable, so elements can be added or removed after creation.
Sets are defined by enclosing elements in curly braces {} or by using the set() function.
python
Copy code
my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

Dictionary:

A dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs, where each key is unique.
Dictionaries are mutable, allowing for modification of keys and values after creation.
Dictionaries are defined by enclosing key-value pairs in curly braces {}, with a colon : separating keys and values.
python
Copy code
my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
These data structures are fundamental in Python and are widely used for various programming tasks due to their flexibility and efficiency.
