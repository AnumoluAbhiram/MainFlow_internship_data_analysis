Task-1

Under Standing the Python Data types:
Description:
This task involves understanding the basic datatypes in Python such as lists, dictionaries, andsets.
Responsibility:
Write a Python program to create a list, a dictionary, and a set. Perform basic operations like adding, removing, and modifying elements.

List:

A list is an ordered collection of items that is mutable, meaning the elements within it can be changed after its creation.
Lists can contain elements of different data types, including other lists.
Lists are defined by enclosing elements in square brackets [].
python
Copy code
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Set:

A set is an unordered collection of unique elements, meaning no duplicates are allowed.
Sets are mutable, so elements can be added or removed after creation.
Sets are defined by enclosing elements in curly braces {} or by using the set() function.
python
Copy code
my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

Dictionary:

A dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs, where each key is unique.
Dictionaries are mutable, allowing for modification of keys and values after creation.
Dictionaries are defined by enclosing key-value pairs in curly braces {}, with a colon : separating keys and values.
python
Copy code
my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
These data structures are fundamental in Python and are widely used for various programming tasks due to their flexibility and efficiency.


Task-2

This task involves using the Pandas library to manipulate data.
Responsibility:
Load a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame. Perform operations like filtering data based on conditions, handling missing values, and calculating summary
statistics.

process:
step-1
Loading the CSV File
Import necessary libraries (e.g., Pandas).
Load the CSV file into a DataFrame using pd.read_csv().
Display the first few rows of the DataFrame using df.head() to ensure it loaded correctly.

step-2
Filtering Data
Explain the need for filtering data based on conditions.
Provide examples of filtering operations:
Filter rows based on column values.
Filter rows using multiple conditions.

step-3
Handling Missing Values
Discuss the importance of handling missing data.
Methods for handling missing values:
Identifying missing values using df.isnull() and df.isna().
Dropping rows or columns with missing values using df.dropna().
Filling missing values using df.fillna().

step-4
Calculating Summary Statistics
Importance of summary statistics in understanding data.
Calculating basic statistics: mean, median, mode, standard deviation, etc.
Using df.describe() for an overview of summary statistics.
